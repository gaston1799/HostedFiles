                <h1>MooMoo/sploop</h1>
                <p>Moomoo.io and sploop.io and basicly the same. and can fight other player build bases to surive and upgrade. MOds started getting popular on this game and almost no one was play legit as this point. it was like you had to have a good mod or you will just die over and over. Then the game started dying because there were to many people using mods. someone remade this game know as sploop.io. This game got more popular than the orignal because this game was alot harder to mod on. Below is a video on both games the first being moomoo.io with my own mod and the second being the sploop.io</p>
